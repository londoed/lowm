lowm is a hobby project to help me understand the nuts and bolts of window managers
and display systems in Linux, while (hopefully) providing something useful to others
in the process. At the moment, lowm will plan to work on X11 with the idea to
support Wayland in the near future. It is also an attempt at balancing the minimalism
of a (dynamic) window manager with the feature set of a full-blown desktop environment and is
partially inspired by System76's "Pop Shell" that brings tiling features to the
GNOME 3 desktop environment. lowm is basically a fork of my favorite window manager,
bspwm, at this time. More details to come!
